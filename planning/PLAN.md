# FinAlly — AI Trading Workstation

## Project Specification

## 1. Vision

FinAlly (Finance Ally) is a visually polished AI-powered trading workstation: it streams live market data, lets users trade a simulated portfolio, and pairs it all with an LLM chat assistant capable of analyzing positions and placing trades on the user's behalf. The goal is for it to feel like a modern Bloomberg terminal with an AI copilot built in, not bolted on.

This is the capstone project for an agentic AI coding course. It is built entirely by Coding Agents demonstrating how orchestrated AI agents can produce a production-quality full-stack application. Agents interact through files in `planning/`.

## 2. User Experience

### First Launch

The user runs a single Docker command (or a provided start script). A browser opens to `http://localhost:8000`. No login, no signup. They immediately see:

- A watchlist of 10 default tickers with live-updating prices in a grid
- $10,000 in virtual cash
- A dark, data-rich trading terminal aesthetic
- An AI chat panel ready to assist

### What the User Can Do

- **Watch prices stream** — each tick briefly flashes green (uptick) or red (downtick), then fades back to the base background over a short CSS transition
- **View sparkline mini-charts** — a compact price trail next to each watchlist ticker, built up on the frontend from the SSE stream since the page loaded (so it starts empty and fills in as data arrives, rather than being backfilled with history)
- **Click a ticker** to bring it up in the larger, more detailed chart in the main chart area
- **Buy and sell shares** — market orders only, filled instantly at the current streamed price, with no fees and no confirmation step
- **Monitor their portfolio** — a treemap-style heatmap where each position is sized by portfolio weight and colored by P&L, alongside a line chart tracking total portfolio value over time
- **View a positions table** — ticker, quantity, average cost, current price, unrealized P&L, and % change, all in one row per holding
- **Chat with the AI assistant** — ask questions about the portfolio, get analysis back, and let the assistant place trades or adjust the watchlist through plain-language requests
- **Manage the watchlist** — add or remove tickers either directly in the UI or by asking the AI chat to do it

### Visual Design

- **Dark theme**: backgrounds around `#0d1117` or `#1a1a2e`, muted gray borders, no pure black — panels should read as slightly-elevated surfaces against the background, not flat blocks
- **Price flash animations**: brief green/red background highlight on price change, fading over ~500ms via CSS transitions; the flash should be noticeable at a glance but never so strong it distracts from reading the number itself
- **Connection status indicator**: a small colored dot (green = connected, yellow = reconnecting, red = disconnected) visible in the header, with a tooltip on hover spelling out the current state
- **Professional, data-dense layout**: inspired by Bloomberg/trading terminals — every pixel earns its place, and whitespace is used deliberately rather than as decoration
- **Responsive but desktop-first**: optimized for wide screens, functional on tablet; below tablet width, panels may stack instead of trying to preserve the full grid

### Color Scheme
- Accent Yellow: `#ecad0a` — used sparingly, for highlights and emphasis (e.g. selected ticker)
- Blue Primary: `#209dd7` — links, secondary buttons, informational accents
- Purple Secondary: `#753991` — reserved for submit/confirm buttons (buy, sell, send chat message)

## 3. Architecture Overview

### Single Container, Single Port

```

│  SQLite database (volume-mounted)               │
│  Background task: market data polling/sim        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript, built as a static export (`output: 'export'`), served by FastAPI as static files
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), managed as a `uv` project
- **Database**: SQLite, single file at `db/finally.db`, volume-mounted for persistence
- **Real-time data**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) — simpler than WebSockets, one-way server→client push, works everywhere
- **AI integration**: LiteLLM → OpenRouter (Cerebras for fast inference), with structured outputs for trade execution
- **Market data**: Environment-variable driven — simulator by default, real data via Massive API if key provided

### Why These Choices

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| SSE over WebSockets | One-way push is all we need; simpler, no bidirectional complexity, universal browser support |
| Static Next.js export | Single origin, no CORS issues, one port, one container, simple deployment |
| SQLite over Postgres | No auth = no multi-user = no need for a database server; self-contained, zero config |
| Single Docker container | Students run one command; no docker-compose for production, no service orchestration |
| uv for Python | Fast, modern Python project management; reproducible lockfile; what students should learn |
| Market orders only | Eliminates order book, limit order logic, partial fills — dramatically simpler portfolio math |

### Key Boundaries

- **`frontend/`** is a self-contained Next.js project. It knows nothing about Python. It talks to the backend via `/api/*` endpoints and `/api/stream/*` SSE endpoints. Internal structure is up to the Frontend Engineer agent.
- **`backend/`** is a self-contained uv project with its own `pyproject.toml`. It owns all server logic including database initialization, schema, seed data, API routes, SSE streaming, market data, and LLM integration. Internal structure is up to the Backend/Market Data agents.
- **`backend/db/`** contains schema SQL definitions and seed logic. The backend lazily initializes the database on first request — creating tables and seeding default data if the SQLite file doesn't exist or is empty.
- **`db/`** at the top level is the runtime volume mount point. The SQLite file (`db/finally.db`) is created here by the backend and persists across container restarts via Docker volume.
- **`planning/`** contains project-wide documentation, including this plan. All agents reference files here as the shared contract.
- **`test/`** contains Playwright E2E tests and supporting infrastructure (e.g., `docker-compose.test.yml`). Unit tests live within `frontend/` and `backend/` respectively, following each framework's conventions.
- **`scripts/`** contains start/stop scripts that wrap Docker commands.

## 5. Environment Variables

```bash
# Required: OpenRouter API key for LLM chat functionality
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key-here

# Optional: Massive (Polygon.io) API key for real market data
# If not set, the built-in market simulator is used (recommended for most users)
MASSIVE_API_KEY=

# Optional: Set to "true" for deterministic mock LLM responses (testing)
LLM_MOCK=false
```

### Behavior

- If `MASSIVE_API_KEY` is set and non-empty → backend uses Massive REST API for market data
- If `MASSIVE_API_KEY` is absent or empty → backend uses the built-in market simulator
- If `LLM_MOCK=true` → backend returns deterministic mock LLM responses (for E2E tests)
- The backend reads `.env` from the project root (mounted into the container or read via docker `--env-file`)

---

## 6. Market Data

### Two Implementations, One Interface

Both the simulator and the Massive client implement the same abstract interface. The backend selects which to use based on the environment variable. All downstream code (SSE streaming, price cache, frontend) is agnostic to the source.

### Simulator (Default)

- Generates prices using geometric Brownian motion (GBM) with configurable drift and volatility per ticker
- Updates at ~500ms intervals
- Correlated moves across tickers (e.g., tech stocks move together)
- Occasional random "events" — sudden 2-5% moves on a ticker for drama
- Starts from realistic seed prices (e.g., AAPL ~$190, GOOGL ~$175, etc.)
- Runs as an in-process background task — no external dependencies

### Massive API (Optional)

- REST API polling (not WebSocket) — simpler, works on all tiers
- Polls for the union of all watched tickers on a configurable interval
- Free tier (5 calls/min): poll every 15 seconds
- Paid tiers: poll every 2-15 seconds depending on tier
- Parses REST response into the same format as the simulator

### Shared Price Cache

- A single background task (simulator or Massive poller) writes to an in-memory price cache
- The cache holds the latest price, previous price, and timestamp for each ticker
- SSE streams read from this cache and push updates to connected clients
- This architecture supports future multi-user scenarios without changes to the data layer

### SSE Streaming

- Endpoint: `GET /api/stream/prices`
- Long-lived SSE connection; client uses native `EventSource` API
- Server pushes price updates for all tickers known to the system at a regular cadence (~500ms) — in the single-user model this is equivalent to the user's watchlist
- Each SSE event contains ticker, price, previous price, timestamp, and change direction
- Client handles reconnection automatically (EventSource has built-in retry)

---

## 7. Database

### SQLite with Lazy Initialization

The backend checks for the SQLite database on startup (or first request). If the file doesn't exist or tables are missing, it creates the schema and seeds default data. This means:

- No separate migration step
- No manual database setup
- Fresh Docker volumes start with a clean, seeded database automatically

### Schema

All tables include a `user_id` column defaulting to `"default"`. This is hardcoded for now (single-user) but enables future multi-user support without schema migration.

**users_profile** — User state (cash balance)
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (default: `"default"`)
- `cash_balance` REAL (default: `10000.0`)
- `created_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)

**watchlist** — Tickers the user is watching
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `ticker` TEXT
- `added_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)
- UNIQUE constraint on `(user_id, ticker)`

**positions** — Current holdings (one row per ticker per user)
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `ticker` TEXT
- `quantity` REAL (fractional shares supported)
- `avg_cost` REAL
- `updated_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)
- UNIQUE constraint on `(user_id, ticker)`

**trades** — Trade history (append-only log)
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `ticker` TEXT
- `side` TEXT (`"buy"` or `"sell"`)
- `quantity` REAL (fractional shares supported)
- `price` REAL
- `executed_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)

**portfolio_snapshots** — Portfolio value over time (for P&L chart). Recorded immediately after each trade execution (no periodic timer).
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `total_value` REAL
- `recorded_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)

**chat_messages** — Conversation history with LLM
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `role` TEXT (`"user"` or `"assistant"`)
- `content` TEXT
- `actions` TEXT (JSON — trades executed, watchlist changes made; null for user messages)
- `created_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)

### Default Seed Data

- One user profile: `id="default"`, `cash_balance=10000.0`
- Ten watchlist entries: AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA, NVDA, META, JPM, V, NFLX

## 8. API Endpoints

### Market Data
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/stream/prices` | SSE stream of live price updates |

### Portfolio
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/portfolio` | Current positions, cash balance, total value, unrealized P&L |
| POST | `/api/portfolio/trade` | Execute a trade: `{ticker, quantity, side}` |
| GET | `/api/portfolio/history` | Portfolio value snapshots over time (for P&L chart) |

The trade endpoint takes no price field. The fill price always comes from the server's own price cache at execution time — the client cannot specify or influence it.

### Watchlist
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/watchlist` | Current watchlist tickers with latest prices |
| POST | `/api/watchlist` | Add a ticker: `{ticker}` |
| DELETE | `/api/watchlist/{ticker}` | Remove a ticker |

### Chat
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/chat/history` | Recent conversation history, for the frontend to restore the chat panel on page load |
| POST | `/api/chat` | Send a message, receive complete JSON response (message + executed actions) |

### System
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/health` | Health check (for Docker/deployment) |

## 9. LLM Integration

When writing code to make calls to LLMs, use cerebras-inference skill to use LiteLLM via OpenRouter to the `openrouter/openai/gpt-oss-120b` model with Cerebras as the inference provider. Structured Outputs should be used to interpret the results.

There is an OPENROUTER_API_KEY in the .env file in the project root.

### How It Works

When the user sends a chat message, the backend:

1. Loads the user's current portfolio context (cash, positions with P&L, watchlist with live prices, total portfolio value)
2. Loads recent conversation history from the `chat_messages` table
3. Constructs a prompt with a system message, portfolio context, conversation history, and the user's new message
4. Calls the LLM via LiteLLM → OpenRouter, requesting structured output, using the cerebras-inference skill
5. Parses the complete structured JSON response
6. Auto-executes any trades or watchlist changes specified in the response
7. Stores the message and executed actions in `chat_messages`
8. Returns the complete JSON response to the frontend (no token-by-token streaming — Cerebras inference is fast enough that a loading indicator is sufficient)

### Structured Output Schema

The LLM is instructed to respond with JSON matching this schema:

```json
{
  "message": "Your conversational response to the user",
  "trades": [
    {"ticker": "AAPL", "side": "buy", "quantity": 10}
  ],
  "watchlist_changes": [
    {"ticker": "PYPL", "action": "add"}
  ]
}
```

- `message` (required): The conversational text shown to the user
- `trades` (optional): Array of trades to auto-execute. `quantity` is a number, not strictly an integer — fractional shares are supported, matching the `REAL` columns in `positions`/`trades` (§7). Each trade goes through the same validation as manual trades (sufficient cash for buys, sufficient shares for sells)
- `watchlist_changes` (optional): Array of watchlist modifications

### Auto-Execution

Trades the LLM decides on are executed immediately, with no confirmation dialog in between. This is a deliberate choice rather than an oversight:
- The money is simulated, so there's no real-world downside to acting without a confirmation step
- It keeps the demo feeling fluid and responsive instead of interrupting the conversation
- It's meant to showcase agentic behavior — an AI that actually acts on its conclusions — which is the point of the course

When a trade fails validation (say, not enough cash for a buy), that failure is surfaced back into the chat response as an error the LLM can read and relay to the user in its own words, rather than a raw error code reaching the frontend.

### System Prompt Guidance

The LLM should be prompted as "FinAlly, an AI trading assistant" with instructions to:
- Analyze portfolio composition, risk concentration, and P&L
- Suggest trades with reasoning
- Execute trades when the user asks or agrees
- Manage the watchlist proactively
- Be concise and data-driven in responses
- Always respond with valid structured JSON

### LLM Mock Mode

When `LLM_MOCK=true`, the backend returns deterministic mock responses instead of calling OpenRouter. This enables:
- Fast, free, reproducible E2E tests
- Development without an API key
- CI/CD pipelines

---

## 10. Frontend Design

### Layout

The frontend is a single-page application with a dense, terminal-inspired layout. The specific component architecture and layout system is up to the Frontend Engineer, but the UI should include these elements:

- **Watchlist panel** — grid/table of watched tickers with: ticker symbol, current price (flashing green/red on change), daily change %, and a sparkline mini-chart (accumulated from SSE since page load)
- **Main chart area** — larger chart for the currently selected ticker, with at minimum price over time. Clicking a ticker in the watchlist selects it here.
- **Portfolio heatmap** — treemap visualization where each rectangle is a position, sized by portfolio weight, colored by P&L (green = profit, red = loss)
- **P&L chart** — line chart showing total portfolio value over time, using data from `portfolio_snapshots`
- **Positions table** — tabular view of all positions: ticker, quantity, avg cost, current price, unrealized P&L, % change
- **Trade bar** — simple input area: ticker field, quantity field, buy button, sell button. Market orders, instant fill.
- **AI chat panel** — docked/collapsible sidebar. Message input, scrolling conversation history, loading indicator while waiting for LLM response. Trade executions and watchlist changes shown inline as confirmations.
- **Header** — portfolio total value (updating live), connection status indicator, cash balance

### Technical Notes

- Use `EventSource` for the SSE connection to `/api/stream/prices`; it reconnects on its own, so the frontend only needs to handle the `onerror`/`onopen` events to drive the connection-status dot, not implement retry logic itself
- Canvas-based charting library preferred (Lightweight Charts or Recharts) for performance, since a DOM-based chart re-rendering on every ~500ms tick would get expensive with several tickers on screen at once
- Price flash effect: on receiving a new price, briefly apply a CSS class with a background color transition, then remove it after the transition completes (e.g. via `transitionend` or a short `setTimeout`) so the class can be re-applied on the next tick
- All API calls go to the same origin (`/api/*`) — no CORS configuration needed
- Tailwind CSS for styling with a custom dark theme; keep the color tokens from the Color Scheme section centralized (e.g. in the Tailwind config) rather than hardcoded per component

---

## 11. Docker & Deployment

### Multi-Stage Dockerfile

```
Stage 1: Node 20 slim
  - Copy frontend/
  - npm install && npm run build (produces static export)

Stage 2: Python 3.12 slim
  - Install uv
  - Copy backend/
  - uv sync (install Python dependencies from lockfile)
  - Copy frontend build output into a static/ directory
  - Expose port 8000
  - CMD: uvicorn serving FastAPI app
```

FastAPI serves the static frontend files and all API routes on port 8000.

### Docker Volume

The SQLite database persists via a bind mount of the project's `db/` directory, so the file is visible on the host at `db/finally.db` (for students to inspect or back up directly, not hidden inside Docker-managed storage):

```bash
docker run -v "$(pwd)/db:/app/db" -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env finally
```

The `db/` directory in the project root maps to `/app/db` in the container. The backend writes `finally.db` to this path.

### Start/Stop Scripts

**`scripts/start_mac.sh`** (macOS/Linux):
- Builds the Docker image if not already built (or if `--build` flag passed)
- Runs the container with the volume mount, port mapping, and `.env` file
- Prints the URL to access the app
- Optionally opens the browser

**`scripts/stop_mac.sh`** (macOS/Linux):
- Stops and removes the running container
- Does NOT remove the volume (data persists)

**`scripts/start_windows.ps1`** / **`scripts/stop_windows.ps1`**: PowerShell equivalents for Windows.

All scripts should be idempotent — safe to run multiple times.

### Optional Cloud Deployment

The container is designed to deploy to AWS App Runner, Render, or any container platform. A Terraform configuration for App Runner may be provided in a `deploy/` directory as a stretch goal, but is not part of the core build.

---

## 12. Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (within `frontend/` and `backend/`)

**Backend (pytest)**:
- Market data: simulator generates valid prices, GBM math is correct, Massive API response parsing works, both implementations conform to the abstract interface
- Portfolio: trade execution logic, P&L calculations, edge cases (selling more than owned, buying with insufficient cash, selling at a loss)
- LLM: structured output parsing handles all valid schemas, graceful handling of malformed responses, trade validation within chat flow
- API routes: correct status codes, response shapes, error handling

**Frontend (React Testing Library or similar)**:
- Component rendering with mock data
- Price flash animation triggers correctly on price changes
- Watchlist CRUD operations
- Portfolio display calculations
- Chat message rendering and loading state

### E2E Tests (in `test/`)

**Infrastructure**: A separate `docker-compose.test.yml` in `test/` that spins up the app container plus a Playwright container. This keeps browser dependencies out of the production image.

**Environment**: Tests run with `LLM_MOCK=true` by default for speed and determinism.

**Key Scenarios**:
- Fresh start: default watchlist appears, $10k balance shown, prices are streaming
- Add and remove a ticker from the watchlist
- Buy shares: cash decreases, position appears, portfolio updates
- Sell shares: cash increases, position updates or disappears
- Selling the entire position removes the row rather than leaving a zero-quantity entry behind
- Portfolio visualization: heatmap renders with correct colors, P&L chart has data points
- AI chat (mocked): send a message, receive a response, trade execution appears inline
- SSE resilience: disconnect and verify reconnection
